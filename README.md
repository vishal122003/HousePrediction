## Features
- **Data Processing:** Clean and preprocess the dataset to prepare it for machine learning models.
- **Feature Engineering:** Extract meaningful features from the dataset and create new features to improve model accuracy.
- **Model Selection:** Experiment with different machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc., to find the best-performing model.
- **Prediction:** Predict house prices based on user input or a given set of features.
- **Visualization:** Visualize the data and model predictions to gain insights into the house price trends.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
2. Navigate to the project directory:
3. Install the required dependencies using `pip`:

## Usage
1. **Data Preparation:**
- Place your dataset file (e.g., `modified.csv`) in the `data/` directory.
- Update the data loading code in the `samplephase4.py` file to load your dataset.

2. **Data Processing:**
- Run the data processing script to clean and preprocess the data:

3. **Model Training:**
- Experiment with different machine learning algorithms in the `ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE_PHASE3.pdf,ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE_PHASE4.pdf` files.
- Train the model using the following command:

4. **Prediction:**
- Use the trained model to make predictions based on user input or a given set of features. Modify the `actualphase4.py` file as needed.
- Run the prediction script:
